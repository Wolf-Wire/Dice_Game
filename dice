/* Play the dice game, where each user chooses the Red, Green or Blue die.
 * 
 * Dice Game
 * This program asks user(s) to enter their chosen die for two players, they can choose between R(ed), G(reen), or B(lue). 
 * The dice are not fair and each die has its own unique structure which will be printed out when the game starts.
 * The program then uses a while loop 50 times to randomly find the winner between the two and keeps track of scores.
 * The last line printed by the program shows the final score and therfore, the winner.
 * The detail of variable, commands and functions can be find next to them below
